# Finale Problem Set #1: Simple Sign Up

---

In this problem set, you will create an application that
utilizes a React frontend that talks to an Express backend.
This backend will make calls to your database.

Your user should be able to type in a name into one input field
and an email into another. Then, they can press a button that
inserts a new document into your 'users' collections that 
has a name field and an email field with values that reflect
the user's input.

If the insertion is successful, display one message on the
screen. If the insertion is not successful, display
another message.

Good luck, you got this!
