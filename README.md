# WebDev Teaching Archive

This repo contains some of the projects I created in 2021 and 2022 when I was an instructor at Amarillo College's [Innovation Outpost](https://www.upskillamarillo.io/). 

The first bootcamp I served more as a Teaching Assistant (TA) helping students in Amarillo as they received instruction from a [remote instructor](https://deepdivecoding.com/) in New Mexico from whom AC leased the content. 

The next bootcamp, AC took over the content and I served as the primary instructor for the program. This involved designing lesson plans for the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, recording videos covering the lesson content, and designing exercises on [Replit](https://replit.com/) and [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). Unfortunately, the videos I recorded and the exercises I created are proprietary but I can make public the optional problem sets I created (Problem-Sets), as well as the code from a live code-along Q&A session about the full Mern stack (MERN-Practice).

After the conclusion of the second bootcamp, I created a website for internal use (TechnoMojo). After completing the first version of the tool and helping with the transition process before the start of the third bootcamp, I started my master's program at UW-Madison.

Each directory in this repo contains the project code, along with explanations and screenshots.

## AC-Gallery-Finder

As a part of my work as a TA during my first bootcamp, I assisted a great group of students on their final project in order to gain insight into the final project experience from the student side. The site we created lets Amarillo residents find local art galleries and artists.

Technologies used:

- Docker for deployment
- Node/Express backend
- React frontend
- SQL for data storage
- Mapbox for showing geographic information
- Bootstrap CSS for quick-and-easy styling

## MERN-Practice

I created this repo during a walkthrough in front of the class during a live Q&A session before the students began working on their final projects in order to demonstrate the entire MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, & Node) stack while answering student questions.

Technologies used:

- MERN

## Problem-Sets

This repo contains the optional problem sets (as MarkDown documents and example projects) I created for students to assist with their learning of the MERN stack. 

Technologies used:

- MERN
- Redux
- Markdown

## Python-Sockets

This repo uses the Python `socket` library to send an email from the terminal or to send a file on the server over HTTP. 

Technologies used:

- Python `socket` library

## TechnoMojo

This repo contains the code for the website (called TechnoMojo) that lets signed-in students view our videos, complete coding exercises, and take quizzes all in one place. It also has an admin dashboard that lets admins view student progress.

Technologies used:

- Node/Express backend
- React frontend
- MongoDB for recording/retrieving student progress
- Testing with Jest and React Testing Library 
- Linting with ESLint
- Accessibility auditing with jsx-a11y
